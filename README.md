<p>We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic .Although we managed to overcome the first wave of covid-19 by proper precautions, the second wave left us no option but to stick to the precautions more strictly and get vaccinated. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
 After the first wave of COVID-19 vaccinations opened up for the 18-44 age group in India, appointments via the Co-win portal were made mandatory.
To help through this severe crisis that effected mankind we have designed a chat bot which will assist you with all the information that you need to know about covid-19 and its related queries. This bot will give directions to register the vaccine, give awareness about the serious symptoms and guidelines to handle the situation if they have Covid-19 symptoms and how to manage the condition. This bot works at any time whenever you need.</p>
📌<b>Key features of the bot is listed below:</b>📌<br><br>
•	On command you will be able to register a district to get vaccinated and select age group (18+ or 45+).<br>
•	Able to get hourly update on open slots if available<br>
•	User will be able to manually check COWIN slots available for their district<br>
•	Navigate to COWIN site if slot available<br>
The most important step to prevent covid-19 transmission is <b>SMS </b>😉 <br> <b>Social distancing <br> Mask <br>Sanitize</b><br> Don’t forget it 😌
Stay Home Stay Safe….<br>
